# surgecheck-service

A simple Java8 / SpringBoot service for indexing Uber's surge multiplier and providing historic metrics for a given time and geolocation.

This application (alongside it's Cordova client app) was developed from concept to a working application in 9 days of part-time pool-side development while attending an Agile conference in Bangalore in April 2015 (in-between curries, cricket, craft-beer and conferencing).

Unfortunately, the application was in violation of Uber's Terms & Conditions (which prohibit aggregating their data), and had to be removed from the Play and App Stores.

But it was a fun exercise in extremely-rapid delivery of a (temporarily) working product! :)

The Cordova client app is available at: https://github.com/shaneagibson/surgecheck-client
